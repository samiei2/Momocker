Mouse Mocker:

This is a university project focusing on creating a program that can do the mouse movement and keyboard typing using Microsoft Kinect V2 SDK.
I have used an existing code for the purpose of controling mouse movement and actions using kinect. The existing code was smooth enought to
move the mouse but some tweaks were added to make the movement for small selections and manipulations even smoother. I have used a combination
of Kalman smoothing and a timed window average of input data for the jitter and noise reduction. To remove hand pose noise that is used for 
clicking I again used a timed window average that made the clicking very reliable.

Features already available:
1.Mouse Movement using either hand
2.Clicks : Left clicks are with the left hand and right clicks are with the right
3.Gesture Recognition added using High Sign project (You should check it out,its really cool and you can define so many unique gestures)

Future features that may be added:
1. Adding typing using mouse movement on an On-Screen Keyboard
  Comment: This is an active area of research so I don't suppose I'll be implementing like that soon but if anyone wants to continue my work
  you should look into papers that investigated and used eye movement for typing.

2. Moving of windows between different screens hosting different operating systems
  Comment: This can also be challenging since you need to not only solve logical choices like if a window moves to a guest OS does it use
  its file system or still only uses its own host OS file system, and also the problem of capturing windows and serializing the whole process
  or screen capture to the other machine. (Very challenging problem specially in Windows API)
  
I have used so many codes from here and there but all of them had either BSD or MIT licenses so you can use my code with the same implied 
licensing as well.
